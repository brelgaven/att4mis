/itet-stor/gtombak/net_scratch/conda_envs/pytcu10/lib/python3.8/site-packages/torchvision/transforms/functional.py:132: UserWarning: The given NumPy array is not writeable, and PyTorch does not support non-writeable tensors. This means you can write to the underlying (supposedly non-writeable) NumPy array using the tensor. You may want to copy the array to protect its data or make it writeable before converting it to a tensor. This type of warning will be suppressed for the rest of this program.
